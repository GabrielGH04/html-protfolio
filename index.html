    A young couple's relationship clashes with the harsh realities of the California Gold Rush of 1850.

    When they meet in second grade, Juli Baker falls instantly in love with her neighbor, Bryce Loski. Bryce, however, does not feel the spark. From that day forward, he (Callan McAuliffe) tries hard to keep brash and unpredictable Juli (Madeline Carroll) at bay. After six years, she begins to feel that she was wrong about him being the love of her life. Unfortunately, that is just about the time that Bryce begins to think he was wrong about Juli, too.

As the couple ponder their romantic future, they find inspiration in Ira (Alan Alda), an elderly man whose decades-long romance with his beloved wife withstood the test of time.
